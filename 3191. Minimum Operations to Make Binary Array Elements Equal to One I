        To solve the problem of flipping consecutive triples in the array to convert all elements to 1, we can approach it through a greedy algorithm. We will traverse the array from 
left to right and whenever we encounter a 0, we will attempt to flip the 3 consecutive elements starting from that index.

This approach is based on the observation that flipping at the earliest index of the zero we see ensures that we're not affecting prior progress made farther to the left. 
However, eventual success depends on whether the array length and positioning of zeroes allow full coverage for flipping. 
If a zero appears too close to the end of the array (less than 2 elements remaining after it), flipping is impossible and thus the task becomes unachievable.

Let's formulate the solution according to this plan:

1.Iterate through the array.
2.Upon encountering a 0, check if it is possible to flip this and the next two elements. If not, return -1.
3.Flip the current and next two elements, and increase the count of flips.
4.Continue until the end of the array.
5. If the iteration completes without hitting the impossibility case, return the count of flips.

Let's proceed to coding the solution using this approach

                # Check if there are at least three elements to flip including current
                if i + 2 < n:
                    # Flip nums[i], nums[i+1], nums[i+2]
                    nums[i] = 1 - nums[i]
                    nums[i + 1] = 1 - nums[i + 1]

                    # Not enough elements to flip
                    return -1
        
        # After all possible flips, check if all elements are now 1
        if nums[-1] == 0 or nums[-2] == 0:
            return -1
