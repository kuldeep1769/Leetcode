        Steps to solve the problem:

        Convert the given number n into its ternary (base-3) representation using repeated division by 3, and check the remainders.
        If any digit in this representation exceeds 1, return false since this would imply a repeated use of that power of three.
        If no such digit is found and all are 0 or 1, return true.
